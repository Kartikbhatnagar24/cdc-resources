Part 1

ML/DL/AI/Data: 1. Revise 'C' & learn C++/Java & Python. Practice a lot. It will help in the long run. r If

possible try to learn 'R' but only after Python.

2. Complete 'Analytics Edge' by edX. 3. Complete the 'Machine Learning course by 'Andrew NG' available on 'Coursera or Youtube.

4. Complete Five modules of deeplearning.ai (https://www.deeplearning.ai) Check it out, it's really a good one. It's also available on youtube. 5. You can learn Data science at Datacamp at

your own pace using the free 3 month individual

subscription through the Github Student

Developer Pack.

6. Create an account on 'Kaggle' & take courses on Data Analytics there. 7. Create an account on 'Analytics Vidhya'. They keep updating about various competitions happening throughout the year. 8. Machine Learning Tips

This Guide is not exhaustive but just a brief overview of

how you can start with the preparation. Take your time

and decide what field you are planning to target.

If it's a software profile that you are targeting then start

doing questions from interview bit or geeks for geeks.

the next academic year.

5. Core CS Concepts:

a. For 3rd yrs: Mainly OOPS asked to

3rd years. Some specific topics in OOPS

that were asked in 2020 are access

modifiers, virtual function, overloading vs

overriding, encapsulation, abstraction.

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/object-

oriented-programming-in-cpp/

b. For 4th yrs: 4th years need to mainly

focus on OOPS, OS, and Networks. A

more thorough preparation might include

DBMS as well. The portions covered in

the academics are more than enough to

be decently prepared.

6. ML: Mostly questions from traditional ML and

prob stats are asked. Understanding the classical ML techniques and their intuition is necessary. Domain-specific questions are also asked mainly based on your resume, so make sure you have a

good understanding of your intern projects,

papers, etc.
