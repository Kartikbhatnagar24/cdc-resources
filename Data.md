CDC Preparation Resources

Part 1


ML/DL/AI/Data:

 

Revise 'C’ & learn C++ / Java & Python. Practice a lot. It will help in the long run. If possible try to learn 'R’ but only after Python.
 

Complete 'Analytics Edge’ by edX.

Complete the ‘Machine Learning’ course by 'Andrew NG’ available on 'Coursera’ or Youtube.
 

Complete Five modules of deeplearning.ai (https://www.deeplearning.ai) Check it out, it's really a good one. It’s also available on youtube.
 

You can learn Data science at Datacamp at your own pace using the free 3 month individual subscription through the Github Student Developer Pack.
 

Create an account on 'Kaggle’ & take courses on Data Analytics there.
 

Create an account on 'Analytics Vidhya’. They keep updating about various competitions happening throughout the year.

For those working in research groups , do your project well. You people will have a higher chance to make it to Inter IIT tech meet in years to come. Your learnings will help you a lot as an individual & also for the Institute.

 

For those who are interning somewhere, please work diligently as your rise in the learning curve, knowledge base, & growth should be your utmost priority. Always keep in mind that you represent your institute at the organization you are working with & you can’t let it down.


Apart from this, revise your concepts of Mathematics 1 & Mathematics 2 taught in your first year. It helps a lot. Try to learn a new language. You may use ‘Duolingo’ for the same. It's a fantastic application. Try to learn a musical instrument if possible. It acts as a stress-buster in difficult times. Play any sport. As you are at home, try to improvise your biological clock. Stay healthy and happy.

 

 

Part 2

 

This Guide is not exhaustive but just a brief overview of how you can start with the preparation. Take your time and decide what field you are planning to target.

 

If it's a software profile that you are targeting then start doing questions from interview bit or geeks for geeks. Try doing all the questions from this link by the start of the next academic year. (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/must-do-coding-questions-for-companies-like-amazon-microsoft-adobe/)

 

Consult seniors who got an internship in a software profile for better preparation methodology. Again for core profiles, seniors of that field are the ones who can actually help you.

 

Now, if you are targeting any Finance/Analyst profile then the following points are a must.

 

 

Probability & Statistics:

Complete all the questions from 50 challenging problems in probability

If you want to study the theory through videos then follow these lecture, of course, Stats 110 (https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home)

If you are a book person then follow the Prob & Stats book by Montgomery

Dice Problems - https://www.madandmoonly.com/doctormatt/mathematics/dice1.pdf

For Puzzles:
 

'Heard on the Street' is a must-do book

If you get additional time and want to leave no stone unturned then do questions from these links too.

Cracking the Coding Interview Book

DSA: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWg7U0OEAoE&list=PLBF3763AF2E1C572F

Core CS Concepts:
For 3rd yrs: Mainly OOPS asked to 3rd years. Some specific topics in OOPS that were asked in 2020 are access modifiers, virtual function, overloading vs overriding, encapsulation, abstraction. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/object-oriented-programming-in-cpp/

For 4th yrs: 4th years need to mainly focus on OOPS, OS, and Networks. A more thorough preparation might include DBMS as well. The portions covered in the academics are more than enough to be decently prepared.

ML: Mostly questions from traditional ML and prob stats are asked. Understanding the classical ML techniques and their intuition is necessary. Domain-specific questions are also asked mainly based on your resume, so make sure you have a good understanding of your intern projects, papers, etc.

Practice: Grimoire of Code CDC Prep Tests, Prepleaf Mocks, Interviewbit etc.
